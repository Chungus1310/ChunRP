## 📖 Documentation

### 🔑 Multiple API Key System

<details>
<summary><strong>How the Smart API Key System Works</strong></summary>

**🔄 Key Rotation Process:**
- **Round-Robin Distribution**: Keys are used in rotation to prevent any single key from being overused
- **Automatic Failover**: If a key hits rate limits or fails, the system instantly switches to the next available key
- **Status Tracking**: Each key is monitored for health (working, failed, rate-limited, untested)
- **Recovery Management**: Failed keys are automatically retried after cooldown periods
- **Load Balancing**: Requests are distributed evenly across all available keys

**💡 Benefits:**
- **Maximum Uptime**: Never get stuck waiting for rate limits to reset
- **Reliability**: If one key fails, others continue working seamlessly
- **Performance**: Distributed load prevents any single key from being overwhelmed
- **Scalability**: Add more keys anytime to increase your request capacity

**🎯 Best Practices:**
- Add 2-3 keys per provider you use frequently
- Monitor key status in the settings to identify problematic keys
- Remove or replace keys that consistently fail
- Different providers have different rate limits - plan accordingly

   };
   ```

2. **Add model configurations**:
   ```javascript
   const modelConfigurations = {
     myProvider: [
       { id: "my-model-1", name: "My Model 1", free: true }
     ]
   };
   ```

3. **Update frontend settings** to include the new provider option in the dropdown.
